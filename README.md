# PulseFi

PulseFi is an AI native analytics platform designed for the Zora creator coin ecosystem. It helps traders make smarter, faster decisions by identifying emerging coin trends, analyzing sentiment, and forecasting value shifts. Built for both developers and professional onchain traders, PulseFi unlocks real time insights through a powerful API, intuitive dashboard, and smart alerting system.

## Project Ideaüåê 

The Zora Coins Protocol enables creators to tokenize content and earn as users trade their coins. While powerful, the space is rapidly evolving ‚Äî new coins appear constantly, and signal to noise ratio is high.

**PulseFi addresses this challenge** by delivering real time intelligence on what‚Äôs moving, why it‚Äôs moving, and what‚Äôs likely to move next.

We focus on two primary user groups:

- **Traders**, who want to spot opportunities early and manage portfolios efficiently.
- **Developers**, who need actionable, AI enriched Zora data for their own tools, bots, and apps.

## How It Works‚öôÔ∏è 

PulseFi ingests live data from the Zora ecosystem (via SDK/API) and enriches it through multiple AI pipelines. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

### 1. Real Time Coin Monitoring
- Continuously listens to Base transactions related to creator coins.
- Detects surges in volume, velocity, and creator activity.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Scrapes captions and cast content from Zora + Farcaster.
- Uses NLP to assign sentiment and buzz scores to each coin.

### 3. Forecast Engine
- Tracks historical performance and volatility for each coin.
- Uses time series models to predict short-term momentum changes.

### 4. Alerts & Dashboard
- Sends real time alerts to users via Telegram, Discord, or email.
- Offers a sleek UI dashboard for visualizing top coins, forecasts, and watchlists.

### 5. Developer API & Webhooks
- Exposes insights through REST APIs and event driven webhooks.
- Easy to integrate into trading bots, dashboards, or analytics tools.

### Built for Builders
A clean, documented API means you can build on top of PulseFi ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre creating dashboards, Discord bots, or automated trading tools.

### Multi Modal Intelligence
PulseFi doesn‚Äôt just track numbers ‚Äî it analyzes text, social behavior, and historical data in combination, giving a deeper, more human like perspective on market activity.
